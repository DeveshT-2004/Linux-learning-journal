## Linux Shell
Shell is an OS-level application that interprets commands and is used to interact with the operating system.

### Types:
1. **Bash**
2. **zsh**

## Linux Terminal
It is an application used to interact with the Linux shell.

## Terminal Paths
- `~` → Home directory  
- `/` → Root directory  
- `..` → Parent of current directory  
- `.` → Current directory  

## Navigation
Use the `cd` command to navigate in the Linux file system.

## Terminal Commands

### 1. `cd`  
Used to change or navigate into directories.  

Examples:  
```bash
cd ~
cd ..
cd /
cd bin
cd ../home/theia
cd ../project
```

### 2. `pwd`
Prints the path of the current working directory.

Example:
```bash
pwd
```

### 3. `ls`
Lists the content of the directory you are currently working in.

Examples:

```bash
ls /[PATH TO DIRECTORY]
ls /
ls /bin
```


## Tab Completion
By pressing the **Tab** key, the command gets auto-completed.

Example:
If you want to go to the `Documents` directory:
```bash
cd do
```
then press **Tab**.

⚡ **Note:**

* Tab completion works only when there is **one valid candidate** for autocompletion.
* If there are multiple possible options, the terminal will wait for you to type more letters until only one match remains.
